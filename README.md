**UD tree manipulation and historical POS tagging**

_Christian Hardmeier_

This repository contains a number of experiments that are grouped together because they
depend on some common code to represent and manipulate Universal Dependency trees.

This should not be considered released software, and documentation is lacking.
Please contact me if you're interested in using any of it.

The only component of general interest is the historical POS tagger in `histpos/histpos.py`.
This is the code that was used for the experiments in the following paper:
